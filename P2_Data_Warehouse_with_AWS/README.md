## <b>Introduction</b>

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

Task is to build an ETL Pipeline that extracts their data from S3, staging it in Redshift and then transforming data into a set of Dimensional and Fact Tables for their Analytics Team to continue finding Insights to what songs their users are listening to.

## <b>Project Description</b>

Application of Data warehouse and AWS to build an ETL Pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift Will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL Statements that create fact and dimension tables from these staging tables to create analytics

## <b>Project Datasets</b>

Song Data Path     -->     s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log Data Path      -->     s3://udacity-dend/log_data
Log Data JSON Path -->     s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

### <b>Song Dataset</b>

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset(https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 
For example:

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### <b>Log Dataset</b>

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format. The log files in the dataset with are partitioned by year and month.
For example:

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what a single log file, 2018-11-13-events.json, looks like.

{"artist":"Pavement", "auth":"Logged In", "firstName":"Sylvie", "gender", "F", "itemInSession":0, "lastName":"Cruz", "length":99.16036, "level":"free", "location":"Klamath Falls, OR", "method":"PUT", "page":"NextSong", "registration":"1.541078e+12", "sessionId":345, "song":"Mercy:The Laundromat", "status":200, "ts":1541990258796, "userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0(Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4...)", "userId":10}

## How to Run
Prerequisites: Configuration file with login details for an active AWS Redshift cluster and ARN for an IAM role with S3 read access.

Run sql_queries.py from terminal or python console to load table create and insert queries.
Run create_tables.py from terminal or python console to create staging and analytical tables.
Run etl.py from terminal or python console to process and load data into data warehouse.
