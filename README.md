## Project 1 - Data Modeling with Postgres
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app and the Task of Data Engineer is creating a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. 

In this Project:
- The Star Schema optimized for queries was created for the database structur designing.
- An ETL pipeline was built to extract data from .json and .log files, transformed and inserted into Postgres tables using Python and SQL.
